The only bug in this code is that isEmpty always returns true,
which causes every other issue.
-addFront appears to function correctly, but only because it thinks
that the list is empty, so it makes the new element the head of the list.
-addBack does not work because it thinks the list is empty so it makes
the new element the head of the new list.
-removeback and removeFront dont do anything because they think the list is
already empty, and therefore remove nothing.
-search works correctly, because it does not depend on isEmpty. it simply uses
the functions of the Node to iterate through the list and get the values.
-size works correctly, because the m_size member variable is still incremented
every addBack and addFront are called, and it is also still decremented whenever
removeFront and removeBack are called.
